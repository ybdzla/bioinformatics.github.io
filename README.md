# Introduction - Part 1
## Step 0 of Bioinformatics -- Question
Science, technology, and philosophy are complementary to each other.
## Step 1 of Bioinformatics -- Information
1. Two major types of information: images and sequences
2. Type of NGS: DNA-seq, RNA-seq, Epigenetics, Interaction
## Step 2 of Bioinformatics -- Analysis
1. NGS Data Analysis: Sequencing Method + Bioinformatics Tool

2. NGS Data Analysis: Interpreting the Data
 For example: UMAP plot, heatmap and so on
## Step 3 of Bioinformatics -- Modeling
### Probabilistic Model
1. Machine learning models: linear regression, logistic regression...
2. Neural network modeld: Deep learning
### Computational Algorithm
1. Number sorting algorithm
2. Dynamic Programming Algorithm
### Difference between Probabilistic Model and Computational Algorithm
#### Probabilistic Model
1. Represents uncertainty: Models systems with randomness or uncertainty.
2. Uses probabilities: Predicts outcomes based on probability distributions.
3. Focuses on prediction: Aims to predict the likelihood of different outcomes.
4. Example: Bayesian networks, Hidden Markov Models.
#### Computational Algorithm
1. Step-by-step process: A set of instructions to solve a specific problem or perform a task.
2. Can be deterministic or probabilistic: Focuses on how to solve the problem, not just uncertainty.
3. Focuses on computation: Provides a method for achieving a desired result, like sorting or searching.
4. Example: Sorting algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort), machine learning algorithms (Neural Networks).


# Study Plan
## Timeline
* week 1-4: Linux
* week 5-16: R
* week 11-16: python
## Action
* Dedicate at least 10 hours each week to reinforce the knowledge points covered in class and engage in practical exercises.
* Learn to solve my own programming problems using search engines like Google.
* Combine the skills learned in class with research projects.
