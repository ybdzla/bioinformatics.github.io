# Introduction - Part 1
## Step 0 of Bioinformatics -- Question
Science, technology, and philosophy are complementary to each other.
## Step 1 of Bioinformatics -- Information
1. Two major types of information: images and sequences
2. Type of NGS: DNA-seq, RNA-seq, Epigenetics, Interaction
## Step 2 of Bioinformatics -- Analysis
1. NGS Data Analysis: Sequencing Method + Bioinformatics Tool

2. NGS Data Analysis: Interpreting the Data
 For example: UMAP plot, heatmap and so on
## Step 3 of Bioinformatics -- Modeling
### Probabilistic Model
1. Machine learning models: linear regression, logistic regression...
2. Neural network modeld: Deep learning
### Computational Algorithm
